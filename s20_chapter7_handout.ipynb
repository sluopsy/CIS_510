        "The topic I want to take up this week is something called \"embeddings\". The general idea is to take some complex structure and reduce it to a vector encoding. And the goal is for the vector to be low_dimensional and compact (non-sparse). So in the hundreds range, not the thousands range. And most importantly, the vector captures \"features\" of the structure in a way that structures that are similar have similar vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our interest is in text so we will look at how to \"embed\" text into a vector. But the applications of embedding are much broader. In our department for example, researchers are attempting to find embeddings for social networks: ways to encode a complex graph structure into a vector. I have seen something similar in Biology, taking Biological networks and reducing them to a vector representation. In fact, looking at your majors, I believe I can find researchers in each looking at embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the attributes of embeddings is that we can use similarity functions on the vectors. Thus we can find social networks that are similar, biological networks that are similar, students that are similar. We will see that with words that are similar in this chapter."

        "The question of how to identify a \"context\" is itself very difficult to answer. In the toy example above, we've said that a \"context\" is just the word that precedes and the word that follows. Depending on your implementation of this procedure, though, you might want a context with a bigger \"window\" (e.g., two words before and after), or a non-contiguous window (skip a word before and after the given word). You might look at larger syntactic structure: what are the syntactic-contexts you find the word in? You might exclude certain \"function\" words like \"the\" and \"of\" when determining a word's context, or you might [lemmatize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation) the words before you begin your analysis, so two occurrences with different \"forms\" of the same word count as the same context. These are all questions open to research and debate, and different implementations of procedures for creating count-based word vectors make different decisions on this issue. In chapter 5, we eliminated stop words but we did not go as far as lemmatizing.\n",
